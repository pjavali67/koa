            History is the very element of life. If you neglect history, you
            will be made to enliven it. But unfortunately, from time immemorial
            history was distorted, tuned and changed to the agony of facts and
            figures. I have tried in my own way to unearth the history of
            Orthopaedics in Karnataka. God has been kind to me, I am perhaps one
            of the oldest living, yet actively practising orthopaedic surgeons
            of Karnataka and I have seen the transformation of our speciality
            from the general surgeons to the crafty hands of the trained
            orthopaedic surgeons from the 1950s and 1960s to 2022. I have
            gathered most of the information from websites, colleagues and from
            different medical college diaries and my own memory.{" "}

            The first M.S (Orth) program in India was started in 1957 by Dr. B N
            Sinha at Lucknow and the next year in Bombay followed by Kolkata,
            Chennai, Patna and other State Capitals thereby promoting trained
            orthopaedic specialists round the country. Till then only Fellows of
            the Royal College of Surgeons deviated from General Surgery to
            Orthopaedics or few graduated from Liverpool School as M.Ch
            Orthopaedics or FRCS Orthopaedics in Canada or Board-certified in
            the United States were practising orthopaedics in India since our
            independence.

            Karnataka State, one of the jewels amongst the States of India was
            born on the 1st November 1956, with the linguistic reorganization of
            states. Karnataka state known as the Silicon State of India is a
            tourists’ paradise, an educational hub and more than all known for
            its jubilant yet simple people, specially orthopaedic surgeons who
            are ethically perfect, morally bound and up-to-date in science and
            technology.

          Till 1961, there was no separate Orthopaedics Department even in the
          two of the oldest medical colleges we had in Mysore and Bangalore
          respectively. Dr. HKS Murthy, FRCS, a Canadian trained Orthopaedic
          Surgeon was posted at Bangalore Medical College and Dr. M Y Rai, an
          FRCS M.Ch UK Trained Orthopaedic Surgeon was posted in the senior-most
          Medical College, Mysore Medical College as Heads of Orthopaedics Unit.
          These were the first independent Orthopaedic Departments from 1962.

            Later, Orthopaedic Departments came into being in Manipal,
            Mangalore, Hubli, Gulbarga, Bellary, Belgaum, Davangere, Mysore and
            Bangalore where other Medical Colleges came into existence. Dr.

            different Medical Schools in Karnataka in the initial stages in the
            early 1970s. Dr. J S Hegde in Mysore, Dr. R. K Sharma and Dr. Putti
            in Belgaum, Dr. Nagaraj, Dr. Krishnappa in Bangalore were the other

            Before 1975, there were many stalwarts like Dr. Gyanchand in
            Bangalore, who later became the Director of Health Services Dr.
            Srinivasan of Chengalpattu who first started the Orthopaedic Unit in
            Mangalore, Dr. N. Arora was the first orthopaedic surgeon in the
            private sector in Bangalore and then Dr. M Srinivasan in Bangalore.
            Dr. Surendra after his M.Ch from Liverpool was the Head in St.
            Marthas for 3 decades from 1973. Other notable names who started the
            orthopaedic departments in different parts of Karnataka State are
            Dr. Erappa Reddy, Dr. Kanaka Reddy, Dr. Sapare, Dr. T.D. Ram, Dr.
            Hiremath, Dr. Somshekhar and others. Dr. Premalatha who was my
            college-mate in Mysore was the first lady Orthopaedic Surgeon from
            Karnataka retired as Professor and Head of the Department at Bellary
            Medical College.

            I have not named anyone who has so ably taken the mantle of
            Orthopaedics in different departments later than 1975 since the list
            is big and I am likely to miss someone. If I have missed anyone, I
            am sure, they won’t mind since for them the Orthopaedic fraternity
            and growth are more important. For history, three of us, Dr.V.Chacko
            from Manipal, Dr.Shantharam Shetty from Mangalore and Dr. Rajiv Naik
            from Bangalore proudly represented Karnataka as the Presidents of
            Indian Orthopaedic Association. Dr. V. Chacko in his vision was the
            first to start speciality departments like the spine, arthroscopy,
            hand, paediatrics and arthroplasty at Kasturba Medical College,
            Manipal. Dr. S. Shetty started the first DNB Orthopaedic Centre in
            Mangalore along with Dr. Thomas Chandy who has a reputed Speciality
            Hospital in Bangalore, namely, Hosmat.{" "}

          <p className="text-justify mt-5 mb-5">
            It is noteworthy that Dr. Mangalore Gopal Kini, the first trained
            Orthopaedic Surgeon from Liverpool, hailed from Mangalore, Karnataka
            and Karnataka is proud that the prestigious M G Kini Oration by the
            Indian Orthopaedic Association is named after him. He started the
            Orthopaedic department in Chennai and Vizag and later moved on to
            Mumbai and started the famous Rehabilitation Orthopaedic Centre
            called the SRCC Hospital Near Haji Ali, Mumbai along with Dr Perin
            K. Mullaferoze, the well-known Lady Orthopaedic Surgeon of India.{" "}

            Karnataka Orthopaedic Association, which is a part of the Indian
            Orthopaedic Association has 1250 members with each of the 31
            districts having their own orthopaedic societies. Dr. M. Y Rai was
            the first President and Dr. J S Hegde was the first Secretary of
            Karnataka Orthopaedic Association, and the association started with
            30 members and has 2090 members as on 31st March 2023. Karnataka has
            60 medical colleges today with full-blown orthopaedics departments
            and more than 30 orthopaedic speciality hospitals with more than 200
            beds in different cities of Karnataka. The work undertaken in these
            hospitals are world-class, be it trauma, arthroplasty, arthroscopy,
            spine, hand, paediatrics, foot and ankle, onco or any other
            speciality.{" "}

          <p className="text-justify mt-5 mb-5">
            In 1970, there were only 4 medical colleges, today we have 66
            medical colleges in Karnataka, one of the highest numbers amongst
            all states. In 1970, there were only 20 orthopaedic surgeons in
            Karnataka. Today we have more than 2000 with 64 postgraduate centres
            including DNB. We have indeed travelled a lot from skeletal
            tractions, hand drills and neglected deformities to the true slogan
            of life is movement and movement is life with newer biotechnologies
            and instrumentation support. The different centres of Karnataka
            Orthopaedic Departments are referral centres and patients from
            different parts of the world specially, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka,
            Nepal, Middle-east and Afro Asian and European countries and even
            from the UK, USA and Canada come to different orthopaedic centres in
            Karnataka for getting their treatment for trauma and orthopaedic
            problems as a part of Medical Tourism.{" "}
          </p>
          <p className="text-justify mt-5 mb-5">
            My appeal to the younger generation is to be more clinically
            oriented, be compassionate and helpful to patients and carry on the
            high traditions of orthopaedics our forefathers have practised and
            left behind. Karnataka has established an indelible mark in the
            history of orthopaedics work in our country and let us march
            forwards firmly in our faith in orthopaedics sustained in our
            confidence in the will of God and the promise of Karnataka
            Orthopaedic Surgeons.
